		<p>If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911 immediately.
		We offer 24/7 emergency care services for life-threatening conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, and severe injuries.
			The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) promptly dispatches well equipped ambulances staffed by well trained paramedics. 
			The staff are certified on regular basis following up-to-date evidence-based protocols. 
		</p>
		<p>A specialist doctor is also involved in pre-hospital care in transferring critically ill patients.
			 The goal of EMS is not only to safely transfer patients to the definite care at the nearest 
			 hospital as quickly as possible,but also to assess patients and commence essential 
			 and potentially life-saving treatment at the scene and during transfer.
